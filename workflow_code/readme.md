<h1> Workflow Code </h1>

This code was written by Serena Qiu and Owen Melville. It uses the Lash-E platform built from the Cytation 5 (Agilent) and North Robotics robotic lab infrastructure with custom code developed at the Acceleration Consortium (https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/North-Cytation). 

- <b>peroxide_workflow.py</b> describes the workflow used, but it requires the Lash-E system code to function
- <b>peroxide_assay_vial_status.csv</b> contains the status of the input vials used to tell the Lash_E system its initial state prior to the workflow
